        <p align="justify">The Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur (IIT Kharagpur or IIT KGP) is a public engineering institution established by the government of India in 1951. It is the first of the IITs to be established, and is recognized as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India.
        As part of Nehru's dream for a free self-sufficient India, the institute was established to train scientists and engineers after India attained independence in 1947. It shares its organizational structure and undergraduate admission process with sister IITs. IIT Kharagpur has a 8.5 square kilometers (2,100 acres) campus is residence to about 22,000 inhabitants. The students and alumni of IIT Kharagpur are informally referred to as KGPians. IIT Kharagpur holds two festivals: Spring Fest (Social and Cultural Festival) and Kshitij (Techno-Management Festival).
        Foundation and Vision
        With the help of Bidhan Chandra Roy (chief minister of West Bengal), Indian educationalists Humayun Kabir and Jogendra Singh formed a committee in 1946 to consider the creation of higher technical institutions "for post-war industrial development of India". This was followed by the creation of a 22-member committee headed by Nalini Ranjan Sarkar. In its interim report, the Sarkar Committee recommended the establishment of higher technical institutions in India, along the lines of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and consulting from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign along with affiliated secondary institutions. The report urged that work should start with the speedy establishment of major institutions in the four-quarters of the country with the ones in the east and the west to be set up immediately.On the grounds that West Bengal had the highest concentration of industries at the time, Roy persuaded Jawaharlal Nehru (India's first prime minister) to establish the first institute in West Bengal. The first Indian Institute of Technology was thus established in May 1950 as the Eastern Higher Technical Institute.[3] It was located in Esplanade East, Calcutta, and in September 1950 shifted to its permanent campus at Hijli, Kharagpur 120 kilometres south-west of Calcutta. Hijli had been used as a detention camp during the British colonial rule in India, to keep Indian freedom fighters captive.
      IIT Kharagpur is the 3rd oldest technical institute in the West Bengal state after Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology Shibpur (1856) and Jadavpur University(established as Bengal technical institute in 1906) When the first session started in August 1951, there were 224 students and 42 teachers in the ten departments of the institute. The classrooms, laboratories and the administrative office were housed in the historic building of the Hijli Detention Camp (now known as Shaheed Bhawan), where political revolutionaries were imprisoned during the British rule. The office building had served as the headquarters of the Bomber Command of the U.S. 20th Air Force during World War II. </p></th>
