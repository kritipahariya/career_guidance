It is considered to be one of the two premier civil services of India, because a candidate, once appointed to the IAS, is rendered ineligible to reappear in the Civil Services Examination. IAS officers serve in strategic and key positions in the Union Government, States governments and public-sector undertakings. Like in other countries following the Westminster system of government, IAS as the permanent bureaucracy in India is an inseparable part of the executive of the Government of India, and hence, provides neutrality and continuity to the administration.  Along with the Indian Police Service (IPS) and the Indian Forest Service (IFS/IFoS), the IAS is one of the three All India Services — its cadre is employed by both the Union Government and the individual States.  Upon confirming to service after probation as Sub-Divisional Magistrate, an IAS officer is given the administrative command in the district as District Magistrate and Collector after a few years of service, and normally, after sixteen years of service in some states, an IAS officer heads a whole division in the state, as its Commissioner. On attaining the Apex Scale, IAS officers go on to head whole Departments and Ministries of the Government of India. IAS officers represent the Government of India at the international level in bilateral and multilateral negotiations. On deputations, they work at Intergovernmental organisations like World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Asian Development Bank, and United Nations or its Agencies. IAS officers at various levels of administration play a vital role in conducting free, fair and smooth elections in India under the direction of Election Commission of India.</span></div></th>
