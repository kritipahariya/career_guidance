		 The benefits of going green are sometimes not as obvious right away. For some, this is the reason that going green can be so difficult. They want to see immediate or near immediate results of their green efforts. Unfortunately, some benefits take time and dedication. This time and dedication can be a benefit of going green in itself. As we become more dedicated to a green lifestyle we learn about that lifestyle, the aspects of the lifestyle that work for us and we learn about new techniques that make the lifestyle easier to create. Other benefits of going green are available in specific areas of green lifestyles.

Benefits of Going Green at Home
Going green at home is one of the few places that green lifestyle benefits are shown quickly or within a short amount of time. The first home benefit that many people who go green see, is a drop in utility bills and spending. As people begin to make subtle and full blown changes in the amount of energy they use and how they use it, the utility bills will drop. This benefit shows itself within the first three billing cycles of the effective changes. Spending also reduces. The spending pattern of green lifestyles shows a spending reduction due to switching from disposable items to reusable items, high priced chemical items for DIY natural options and swapping out appliances for more energy effiencent models. Not only are the benefits seen in healthier lifestyle options, but they are also seen in healthier financial options.
